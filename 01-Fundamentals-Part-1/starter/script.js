console.log(result, firstName, num);

NOTES
Number: Floating point numbers -> Used for decimals & integers.
let age = 23;

String: Sequence of characters -> Used for text.
let firstName = "Jesse";

Boolean: Logical type that can only be true or false.

Undefined: Value taken by a var that is not yet defined ('empty value').
let children;

Null: Also means 'empty value'.

Symbol: Value that is unique and cannot be changed.

BigInt: Larger integers than the Number type can hold.

JavaScript has dynamic typing: We do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a var. Instead, data types are determined automatically.
